            <p>This is the body section of our blog post. In this section I will write about things. I'll be sure to use
                the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags I've been learning how to code. </p>
            <p>This is another paragraph, and I would like to quote the late, great Martin Luther King Jr. who once said
                <q>I have a dream</q></p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/martin-luther-king-jr">
                <p>I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for
                    freedom in the history of our nation.</p>
                The King family had been living in Montgomery for less than a year when the highly segregated city
                became the epicenter of the burgeoning struggle for civil rights in America, galvanized by the landmark
                Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954.
